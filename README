                                 Blade
                                 =====

Blade is in very early, skeletal stages, but here's a vague synopsis
of the currently intended future:

Blade is a programming language designed for freedom of declaration. A
Blade program is a collection of resources which describe general
aspects of the program, such that multiple resources can collectively
describe a single value. Furthermore, the program itself determines
the meaning of these resources.

Besides that, Blade is rather nebulous. In a sense it has to be, since
by Blade's very nature a project can include a compiler, code written
for that compiler, and other incidental Blade code, all three of which
can make statically resolved references to each other as part of the
same program.

That said, a lispy core dialect is provided which has support for
fexprs, continuations, keyed dynamic variables, and an extensive pure
functional subset. This dialect prioritizes being complete,
convenient, and adaptable to new paradigms, in that order, in the hope
that this approach will promote the development and interoperability
of further dialects which emphasize other language qualities such as
minimalism, verifiability, and performance.

Like so many other languages, Blade is so many other languages in
theory, and it's only so many other languages at the moment.
